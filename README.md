## Overview

This project is dedicated to digitalize pteropod abundance maps from the CalCOFI Atlas No. 6 (McGowan 1967).
Species maps have been scanned, saved as TIFF images and stored in the [`data/`](https://github.com/FRBCesab/calcofi/tree/main/data) directory.



## Workflow

The R function [`digitizer()`](https://github.com/FRBCesab/calcofi/blob/main/R/digitizer.R) is used to interactively extract information from maps and save data in the [`outputs/`](https://github.com/FRBCesab/calcofi/tree/main/outputs) directory. `digitizer()` works as follow:

- Import a `.tiff` stored in the [`data/`](https://github.com/FRBCesab/calcofi/tree/main/data) directory
- Plot the image
- Ask user to extract metadata (species, cruise, and date)
- Ask user to define the spatial axes
- Ask user to click on data points
- Convert coordinates in WGS84 system
- Ask user to extact point values
- Save data (`.csv` file) in the [`outputs/`](https://github.com/FRBCesab/calcofi/tree/main/outputs) directory

After this pipeline is completed for one image, the next image is automatically loaded until all images are processed.

When the output (`.csv` file) is created, the image is considered as processed and it will never be imported again by `digitizer()`. Thus user can digitize maps over a long period.



## Content

This repository is structured as follow:

- [`DESCRIPTION`](https://github.com/frbcesab/calcofi/blob/main/DESCRIPTION): contains project metadata (authors, description, license, dependencies, etc.).
- [`R/`](https://github.com/frbcesab/calcofi/blob/main/R): contains R functions developed especially for this project.
- [`data/`](https://github.com/frbcesab/calcofi/blob/main/data): contains raw data used in this project (CalCOFI maps).
- [`outputs/`](https://github.com/frbcesab/calcofi/blob/main/outputs): contains outputs of the project (one `csv` file per map).



## Installation

To install this project:

- [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects) this repository using the GitHub interface.
- [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) your fork using `git clone fork-url` (replace `fork-url` by the URL of your fork). Alternatively, open [RStudio IDE](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/) and create a New Project from Version Control.

For users that are not familiar with `git`, [download the ZIP](https://github.com/FRBCesab/calcofi/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) of the project.



## Usage

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not use RStudio or Positron to run this project. It depends on the [`locator()`](https://rdrr.io/r/graphics/locator.html) function not supported by these two IDE.

- Open a Terminal (Windows user can open Git Bash)
- Launch R by typing `R`
- Install the `devtools`, `cli` and `recolorize` packages

To run the project:

- Navigate to `calcofi` directory by using `setwd()`
- Load the project by running `devtools::load_all()`
- Start digitalizing maps with `digitizer()`

You will be ask to answer some questions and to click on the map. Just follow instructions.

After digitalizing a first map, have a look at the `outputs/` directory: data should have been saved as a `csv` file (see the [example](https://github.com/FRBCesab/calcofi/blob/main/outputs/Example_of_Output.csv)).
The name of the `csv` will be the same as the image.
